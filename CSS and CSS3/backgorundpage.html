        Conway, who made his debut against the West Indies in November last year, recently scored a 99 not out against Australia in the recently-concluded T20I series and now finds a way into the ODI set-up. Young scored two one-day hundreds for New Zealand XI against Australia XI in 2019 before surgery on his shoulder cut his year short.

"Devon, Will and Daryl are quality players and have enjoyed impressive seasons so far, and we're looking forward to giving them further opportunities to develop their game at this level," selector Gavin Larsen said on Wednesday (March 10). "Whilst it's disappointing to lose a player of Kane's class, Tom has proven experience in taking the reins and I know he's excited to lead the side.

"It's certainly been a while since we've played ODI cricket, with just four games since the 2019 Cricket World Cup campaign. We're now in a new World Cup cycle and our attention has turned to building towards the 2023 tournament in India. This series is a great opportunity to begin laying those foundations and formulating the type of team and game-plan we think can continue our impressive run in this format."

The bowling, comprising Trent Boult, Matt Henry, Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson, bears a similar look.

"The bowling group is a strong and experienced one and will be well complemented by the two seam-bowling all-rounders in Jimmy and Daryl. We've also taken the decision to carry just the one spinner in the squad, which is a reflection of the venues for this series and expected pitch conditions. It's great to have Bangladesh on our shores and we know they'll bring a lot to the series," Larsen added.

The first ODI, which will be Latham's 100th, is set to be played on March 20 in Dunedin.
